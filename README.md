### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™ve recently moved to Germany and now I am looking for a job
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently investing time in Digital Marketing bootcamp, Agile project management and also german lenguage
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects with real impact to the world
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like to work and to know people from arround the globe. Morover, to share different points of view about the same goal and focus on developing data innovation solutions, without forgetting our mental health's balance. 
That's the main reason why I also like learning, training and reading books about personal-growth. 
I love cats. I consider that they are super funny! Besides, hikking into the nature and play the guitar as well
